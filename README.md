# Jarvis
A basic personal assistant for windows computer using python.


There are also java files as I started to work on this project in Java(half done).

But, for python users you need python 3.6 with nltk,pyaudio libraries installed.
Just download these 3 files and you are good to go.
  1) jarvis.py
  2) commandGenerator.py
  3) recordspeech.py

Also, remember for text to speech I am using an open souce software espeak. So, you will need to download and install espeak.
In folder "C:\Program Files (x86)\eSpeak\command_line" there will be a espeak.exe file copy it to your folder location. 

After these initial steps run the jarvis.py file.
